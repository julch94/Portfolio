# **About Me**

*E-mail Address:* julch94@gmail.com

My name is Nick Julch and I am a professional Systems Engineer and hobbyist Game Designer and Developer.

Throughout my career in engineering I've primarily practiced design, integration, and test of complex electrical, mechanical, and software integrated systems. My key skills and tool proficiencies related to Game Design and Development include:

*	C# and C
*	Unity
*	Git and GitHub
*	Technical Writing
*	Engineering Leadership
*	System Integration and Test
*	Troubleshooting and Debugging

Though my professional experience does not include any game design or development, I have been designing and/or developing games since my childhood. My passion is making things work together. At work this means complex avionics systems and teams of engineers and integrators. In my personal work this means using a variety of tools and resources developed by others to create something fun and interesting - *a game*. 

This portfolio outlines some of the projects I have developed over the last few years along with tools and lessons I've learned with them. Each project listed below also contains a link to a page with additional information including things like screenshots and videos from the games, design concepts/problems/solutions, and a link to the playable game.
