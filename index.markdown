# **About Me**

*E-mail Address:* julch94@gmail.com

My name is Nick Julch and I am a professional Systems Engineer and hobbyist Game Designer and Developer.

Throughout my career in engineering I've primarily practiced design, integration, and test of complex electrical, mechanical, and software integrated systems. My key skills and tool proficiencies related to Game Design and Development include:

*	C# and C
*	Unity
*	Git and GitHub
*	Technical Writing
*	Engineering Leadership
*	System Integration and Test
*	Troubleshooting and Debugging

Though my professional experience does not include any game design or development, I have been designing and/or developing games since my childhood. My passion is making things work together. At work this means complex avionics systems and teams of engineers and integrators. In my personal work this means using a variety of tools and resources developed by others to create something fun and interesting - *a game*. 

This portfolio outlines some of the projects I have developed over the last few years along with tools and lessons I've learned with them. Each project listed below also contains a link to a page with additional information including things like screenshots and videos from the games, design concepts/problems/solutions, and a link to the playable game.

## Ultimate Prey

[Gameplay and More for Ultimate Prey - Click Here](/ultimate_prey/)

Ultimate Prey is a battle-royale meets party meets survival game. This game is intended to be played multiplayer with a single Host player acting as the lobby leader for Clients to connect to. The objective of the game is to find the key and escape the island filled with hunters and other threats. To do so, the players must use these threats against the other players and take advantage of the item chests that spawn across the map. Only one player can escape and be the winner.

**Top 5 Skills and Lessons Learned:**
*   State Machines and Behavior Trees
*   LOD Models
*   Multiplayer Networking
*   Developing and utilizing re-usable functions, scripts (including some utilities), and prefabs
*   Play-testing and gathering feedback

Made with Unity, C#, Audacity, Mirror Networking for Unity, and a mix of free and paid assets

## Chick Game

Chick Game is an FPS where you play as a rooster who must care and tend to his hens and chicks during the day and defend the coop at night from waves of different predators. During the day time the player collects buffs to their damage, health, and move speed to aid them in their defense of the coop at night against raccoons, foxes, and other threats. The player is armed with a Rooster-grade shotgun and their own claws at night to defend the coop - if the predators reach the coop and attack it for too long, the flock begins to die and the game will be lost.

**Top 5 Skills and Lessons Learned:**
*   Developing useful milestones and projects using GitHub
*   Creating custom animations in both Blender and Unity using models from the Unity Asset Store
*   Unity Audio System
*   Developing design documentation for another developer to implement
*   Troubleshooting complex game logic and developing custom solutions to do so

Made with Unity, C#, Audacity, Blender, and a mix of free and paid assets.

## Waifu Hunter 2077

[Gameplay and More for Waifu Hunter 2077 - Click Here](/waifu_hunter_2077/)

Waifu Hunter 2077 was my first project in Unity and I jumped right in on a multiplayer PVE FPS game. It's a game where you and some friends load into a few levels and defeat waves of enemies. Thought not a very complicated game, multiplayer networking is extremely complicated compared to the typical subjects a new developer must tackle. The co-creator of this game also introduced me to Git which I learned so we could collaborate on this game. 

**Top 5 Skills and Lessons Learned:**
*   Git and GitHub
*   Implement multiplayer networking solutions from an existing design
*   Unity Animation System
*   Working with Unity Asset Store assets
*	Collaborating with another developer and properly splitting responsibilities

Made with Unity, C#, Mirror Networking for Unity, and all free assets.

## GG2

[Gameplay and More for GG2 - Click Here](/gg2/)

GG2 is a top down dungeon crawler built to run in a web browser using HTML5. You play as a mage who must explore each level, collecting new abilities and upgrades, and defeat 3 main bosses to get to the final boss. This game was my final project using the GameMaker engine. If I spent just one day to work on an upgrade to this game it would be to scrap most of the enemies from each level and fix the monitor sync rate issue. This would let the cool bosses and systems of the game really shine. 

**Top 5 Skills and Lessons Learned:**
*   Quality over quantity
*   Platform testing and understanding hardware impacts
*   Using resource packs and adapting them to your needs
*   Level and system design
*	GameMaker was great to learn with but it was time to move to Unity or Unreal Engine

Made with GameMaker, C++/GML, and a mix of hand-made and free assets.
